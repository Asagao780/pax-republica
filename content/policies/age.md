Pax Republica contains adult themes and situation, including violence, language, sexual content. If you are under the age of 18, this game is probably not for you.

Characters must be at least 16 years old; younger concepts will not be approved. That said, any sexual activity involving minor characters will be dealt with harshly. See [NEWS ADULT](/policies/adult) for more information.
