Pax Republica uses a simple coded space system simulating ships, planets, and star systems. It is intended to facilitate roleplay, while maintaining the immersive feeling of being in space, and travelling between systems. There is no travel delay when jumping through hyperspace from one star system to another, allowing players to meet in distant locations without introducing unnecessary wait times in order to roleplay.

Space combat is similarly simple, using player-driven rolls when necessary, but relying more on roleplay than roll-play. Ships are set up with stats for weapons, shields, and hull, but movement is intended to be handled through roleplay rather than meticulously tracked player and ship locations. Players are expected to roleplay their ships in line with the stats they possess.

In order to start the game with a ship of their own, players must take the SHIP bonus in Character Generation, and will be able to customize a ship worth a total of 100k credits. For information on how to build your ship, see [Ships](/systems/space/ships). If a player wishes to purchase a ship IC, visit an IC ship vendor.
