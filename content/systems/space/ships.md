Owning a ship on Pax Republica is something that is available to everyone, through one means or another. Either you've earned enough credits to purchase one, or you've arranged a loan with another player, or with staff; whatever the case, here's where you can spec out your new ship. By design, ship construction here is left very generic; it's up to you to decide on the details of your vessel to make it your own. While there are no doubt common classes and designs in the Galaxy, your ship can be as unique as your character.

For balance purposes, all capital class ships will be designed by staff.
