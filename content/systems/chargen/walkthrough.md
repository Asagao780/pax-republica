The Character Generation system on Pax Republica should feel familiar to experienced MUSHers who have played on past Star Wars MUSHes, but be easy enough for new players to understand and progress through. We use a variation of the D6 roleplaying system, so if you're unfamiliar we suggest you read through our [D6](/systems/d6) information file before beginning Character Generation.

**Basic Information**

Here you will be able to choose your character's species, from the available [races](/theme/races), and set your character's basic details like gender, height, weight, hair, eyes, and skin, as well as your in-game description.

**Force Sensitivity**

Any player may create a Force Sensitive character, without it being considered one of their character bonuses. This comes with a few caveats to consider. 
  * A player may possess only one Force Sensitive character at a time.
  * In game terms, non-Jedi Force Sensitives will be considered potential threats, or even enemies of the Jedi Order, and treated as such by the Jedi. This doesn't mean you _can't_ play a non-Jedi Force User, but be aware of the challenges doing so may create.
  * Force Sensitive characters are subject to Dark Side Point rules, and accruing a high Dark Side Point count may potentially result in your character being consumed by the Dark Side, at which point they become largely unplayable.
  * Characters with Force Sensitivity are not given additional skill or attribute dice to use toward Force abilities. These will have to come out of the character's regular attribute or skill dice pool.

**Bonus selection**

Every character may choose a start-up bonus from the following:
  * 2D+0 additional attribute dice.
  * 7D+0 additional skill dice.
  * A ship with a value of up to 100,000 credits.
  * Up to 100,000 credits worth of cybernetic enhancements.
  * 100,000 credits to be spent IC as the player likes.

**Attributes**

These represent your character's overall talent, aptitude, and physical ability, and provide a base value for all the skill in their respective trees. All characters are given a total of 18D+0 (20D+0 if you chose the attribute bonus) attribute dice, minus the minimums for their selected race, to distribute within the bounds of your character's racial minimum and maximum values.

**Skills**

Skills represent your character's trained or learned abilities, and build on the attribute values set in the previous step. All characters are given 12D+0 in skill dice (or 19D+0 if you chose the skills bonus). These may be distributed as you like, with the following restrictions:

  * No skill may be set more than 2D+0 above the racial attribute maximum for that skill's parent attribute. If you're Human, this means that 6D+0 is the highest you can set a skill in Character Generation.
  * No more than 3D+0 may be placed in any single skill.
  * You must have at least 8 skills visible on your sheet in order to progress to the next step.

  These restrictions are intended to prevent players from unreasonably min/maxing their character sheet, and to give everyone a more well-rounded set of abilities.

**Specializations**

Specializations are special skills which represent a character's focus on a certain specific aspect of the parent skill, and can only be used in specific situations. For example, the "Blaster Pistol" specialization may replace the "Shoot" skill, when the character is using a blaster pistol, but not when they are using a blaster rifle, bowcaster, or firearm. Specializations chosen in Character Generation are given at 1D+0 above the parent skill level, and cannot be raised further until your character is approved. After approval, specializations may be raised at half the regular Character Point cost, rounded up. You may choose up to three specializations in Character Generation.

**Traits**

Traits are character advantages or flaws which go beyond what skills and attributes can easily define. They allow you to choose quirks, talents, and conditions to further expand and define your character. You can choose as many or as few traits as you want, but they all have a point value; traits which provide an advantage cost points, while those which put your character at a disadvantage refund points.

Choose your traits carefully; while they provide bonuses or penalties to your character rolls, they are intended more to add more dimension to your character, and your roleplay. Don't take a trait you don't intend to play.

**Languages**

The number of languages you can speak is determined by your Languages skill, or your Knowledge attribute if you haven't raised Languages. All characters begin with their racial default language, and you may purchase as many additional languages as you have available points for.

Please note that if you wish to learn a restricted language, you must have points in the Languages skill above your Knowledge attribute base value. To learn a restricted language, please submit a +request to staff. Understand that restricted languages may have additional requirements, depending on the rarity of the language.

**Background**

Your background tells us where your character came from, and how they got to where they are now. Where they were born, how they grew up, any defining events in their life. There is no minimum or maximum length for your background, but while staff doesn't want to sift through novels, your background should be long enough to give us a clear picture of who and what your character is.

Any high-level skills should be justified in your background. While we don't require every item on your sheet to be explained, your background and your sheet should be compatible at a glance. If your sheet is combat-based, but there is no evidence of combat training in your background, staff will ask for you to revise.

**Review and Submit**

Take a look over your character's information, sheet, and background, and be sure that you're happy with your work before submitting your application. It may take some time to review and approve your character, so be patient. We'll let you know by @mail when you've been approved, or if there are any changes that need to be made.
