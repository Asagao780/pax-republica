You have a natural equilibrium which puts other members of your species to shame. You can walk a tight rope, or across a narrow ledge without fear of falling. Your natural equilibrium makes you difficult to put off balance, and allows you to perform otherwise difficult acrobatic feats with relative ease. You gain a 1D+0 bonus to Acrobatics, Climb, Leap, and Ride.
