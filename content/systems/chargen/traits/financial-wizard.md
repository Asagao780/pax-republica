Rich and poor want you guiding their personal or company fortune. You understand the market and have a flair for picking out the stock, commodity or company that is going to rise. With a nose for upcoming disaster you keep yourself and those you work for solvent even in the worst crisis.

You gain a 1D+0 bonus to Value, Bargain, and Persuade when rolled for business or money-related skills; in the event of a disagreement of what this bonus may relate to, defer to your GM.
