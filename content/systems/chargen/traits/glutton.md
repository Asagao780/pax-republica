With an appetite that knows no bounds (a gourmet appreciates the fine side of dining) a glutton is hard to satisfy, needing quantity over quality. You never have enough food. 

A glutton receive a 1D+0 penalty to Willpower for the purposes of resisting the temptation or urge to eat, plus an additional 0D+1 penalty for every three hours that pass since he was last able to eat. This penalty is also applied when the glutton is being questioned or interrogated, and the threat of withholding food is being held over him. This penalty cannot lower a character's Willpower below 1D+0.
