You are lighter on your feet than other members of your species, which makes you quicker and more nimble than average. You can move more quietly, and with greater finesse than others. You gain a 1D+0 bonus to Sneak in situations where moving silently is a relevant factor. You may choose one of Acrobatics, Dodge, or Leap to increase by 0D+1 in CharGen at no additional cost.
