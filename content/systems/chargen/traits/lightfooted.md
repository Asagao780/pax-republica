You are quicker on your feet than other members of your species, and 

Nimble and quick when you are out on the dance floor people take notice. If a thief, you don’t trip alarms that the average burglar would set off. If you fight with a sword or staff, you’re light enough on your feet to keep your opponent guessing as you dodge and attack. 1D+0 bonus to acrobatics, climb, brawl, dodge, melee, and leap.
