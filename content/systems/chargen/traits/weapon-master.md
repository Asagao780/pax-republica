It's entirely possible that you emerged from the womb (chrysalis, egg, cloning vat) with a sword in one hand and a knife in the other. You have an uncanny natural ability in the arts of melee combat, and any weapon you choose to wield becomes even deadlier in your expert hands. You gain a 1D+0 bonus to all Melee rolls and specializations.
