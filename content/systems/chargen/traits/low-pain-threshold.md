You are more sensitive to pain than other members of your species, and what might seem to others to be a minor bump or bruise can be a painful injury for you. When you take a hit of any kind, you must pass a Moderate Willpower check to withstand the pain, otherwise you will suffer the effects of one greater wound level than normal for one round before it reduces to the normal wound level. For example, if you are hit and suffer a Stunned wound level, you will instead suffer the Wounded effects for one round.
