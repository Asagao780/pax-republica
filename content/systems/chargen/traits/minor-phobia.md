You have an irrational and lasting fear of certain situations, activities, or objects which can send you into paroxysms of fear. When exposed to the source of your phobia, you must overcome a Moderate Willpower check or suffer a kind of mental and physical paralysis, which prevents you from acting in the current round. If your roll is successful, you may act as normal for the rest of the scene. 

You must specify the source of your phobia when selecting this trait. Common phobias include insects, serpents, wild animals, domestic animals, heights, storms, loneliness, aliens, heights, water, and fire.
