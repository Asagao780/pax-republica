Does the sight of a certain alien race provoke a deep sense of dread or anxiety? Does even the thought of standing on a high balcony make you want to roll up into a ball? You have an uncontrollable, irrational, and lasting fear of certain situations or activities or objects which can paralyze you or send you into paroxysms of fear. Some common phobias are to insects, serpents, wild animals, domestic animals, heights, fear of storms and lightning, fear of the outdoors, fear of being alone, fear of ‘aliens’.
