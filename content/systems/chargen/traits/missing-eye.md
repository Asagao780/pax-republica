You have one less eye than other members of your species. You can see, but your depth perception is significantly impaired, making it difficult to drive, fly, or shoot. You suffer a 1D+0 penalty to any action in which depth perception plays a key role, such as those mentioned. On the upside, eye-patches are in fashion in the Outer Rim.

You may buy out this disadvantage for a cost of 30CP, if you wish to replace your missing eye with a prosthetic, or if you've scooped out some other organic eye to fill the hole in your ~~soul~~ socket.
