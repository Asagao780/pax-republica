Whether through natural or artificial means, your powers of hearing are considerably better than others of your species. Though you do not necessarily hear in a range outside of what is normal for your species, you are able to hear sounds which are quieter or further away than the average. You are also able to better differentiate individual sounds among a cacaphony, and identify beings more easily by their voice.

You gain a 1D+0 bonus to Search when listening for clues, and a 0D+1 bonus to any Awareness or Coordination skill roll where hearing may be a determining factor, at the discretion of the GM.
