You have an uncanny knack for crafting devices, machines, and systems from everyday items in order to solve an immediate problem. Need to open a locked door, and all you have is a paperclip, a match, and a rubber band? Somehow, you can make it work. You gain a 2D+0 bonus to technical skills for short-term or single-use solutions involving a crafted device, at the discretion of the GM.
