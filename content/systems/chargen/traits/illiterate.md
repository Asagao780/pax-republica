Being illiterate puts you at a disadvantage in many situations in modern life from operating a space craft to voting in a local election. Tasks requiring reading and writing in oneâ€™s language will necessitate help. Many illiterate people find work arounds such as memorizing the positions on a control panel or relying on someone to tell them which switch to turn on. ((1D+0 penalty for knowledge rolls? Or maybe a penalty to bluff rolls?))
