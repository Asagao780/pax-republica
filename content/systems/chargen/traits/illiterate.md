Being illiterate puts you at a disadvantage in many situations in modern life from operating a space craft to voting in a local election. Tasks requiring reading and writing in oneâ€™s language will necessitate help from people who can read and write. Many illiterate people find work arounds such as memorizing the positions on a control panel or relying on someone to tell them which switch to turn on. Not being able to read caution signs and instructions will put you and others in serious danger at times.

Penalties for this trait will be applied as deemed appropriate by the GM on a case by case basis.
