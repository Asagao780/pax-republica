You find social situations difficult, to put it mildly. Interacting with others, particularly in groups, is a trial; you might suffer any number of social afflictions such as stuttering, sweating, nausea, or inability to speak, but the end result is that you don't do well in any kind of a crowd. You suffer a 1D+0 penalty to any Presence skill roll when interacting in groups of more than two.
