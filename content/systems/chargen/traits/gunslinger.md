You have a blaster and will travel. Hired for protecting someone in the guise of a bodyguard or for protecting a community, you are known for being quicker and more ruthless than the average citizen who can use a blaster.

A Gunslinger receives a 2D+0 bonus to any Shoot roll, or a 1D+0 bonus to a specialization of the Shoot skill. They also receive a 0D+2 bonus to their Dodge rolls when evading blaster fire. Finally, the Gunslinger gains a 0D+2 bonus when rolling initiative during a gunfight.
