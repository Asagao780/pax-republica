You have confidence and assuredness coming out of your pores, and everyone can see it. You are absolutely sure of your own abilities, and you aren't afraid to show it. On the one hand, your natural confidence and strength can inspire that in others, but on the other you have a tendency to bite off more than you can chew.

You gain a 1D+0 bonus to Persuade, Lead, and Intimidate, and Willpower. However, you also believe that you can handle almost anything on your own, so at the GM's discretion you must pass a Willpower check (without bonus) to resist the urge to charge in on your own without forming a coherent plan.
