You are afflicted with a crippling addiction, whether it is psychological or physical, and can't seem to break free of it. It may have started as a minor vice which didn't significantly interfere with your life, but by now it's a problem. You might not even realize that you have this addiction, but if you don't feed it regularly you will suffer the ill-effects of withdrawl.

For every day you go without feeding your addiction, you suffer a 0D+1 penalty to all attributes, up to a maximum of 2D+0, or if your attribute reduces to 1D+0 total. If after one week you are still not able to feed your addiction, you will gain a Wounded injury level which will persist until you have fed your addiction.

You may buy out this disadvantage for a cost of 30CP, however doing so will also reduce a random attribute by 0D+1, which you may mitigate by spending CP to immediately buy back at the regular cost.
