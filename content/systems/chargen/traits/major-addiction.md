Addiction is the parasite in your brain that you must feed whether it costs you all your worldly goods, your family and your health. In the first stages, you might be taking spice or smoking nicotine sticks because you feel euphoric or more relaxed. You probably think that you have a handle on how much of the substance you consume but you develop a tolerance that requires more and more of it to get high. That high is better than anything else going on in your life you mistakenly think. Some addictions, if you live long enough, actually can wane with age, leaving its marks in impaired mental and physical functions. Penalty 1D+2 to Awareness and Reflex rolls.
Addictions will likely affect the performance of Bounty Hunter, Freedom Fighter, Mercenary, Scavenger, Smuggler, Soldier, Swoop Racer, and Thief.
