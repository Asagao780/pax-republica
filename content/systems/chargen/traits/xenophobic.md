Hate is a strong word, but you are possessed of an irrational aversion to sentients of a species not your own. Whether you can admit it or not, you only really _like_ your own kind. You find it difficult to relate to, work with, or otherwise interact with other species, and suffer a 1D+0 penalty to any Presence skill roll when directed toward a member of another species.
