You smell. Not in the way that Rodians smell bad to non-Rodians. It's not pheremones, it's just gross. Whether it's body odour, constant gas, or some other noxious substance which emanates from you, other beings who possess olfactory senses find you disgusting to inhale around. You suffer a 0D+2 penalty to any interpersonal rolls made in close proximity to the target, unless the target lacks the ability to smell.
