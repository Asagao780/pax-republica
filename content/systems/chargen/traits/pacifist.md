You do not condone or believe in, and refuse to participate in activities which involve violence of any kind. When faced with a violent situation, you must roll a Very Difficult or better Willpower roll to be able to disregard your beliefs in order to act, if you feel that you should; for example if intervention might save a life. If you physically harm another being during any action, you suffer a 1D+0 penalty to Willpower until you are able to atone for the transgression.
