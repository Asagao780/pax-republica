Any time you get into a moving vehicle, you suffer from extreme nausea. This makes most forms of travel unpleasant, but space travel even moreso; stasis pods are your friend. This is a terrible thing to suffer from if you're a pilot or a driver, as you suffer a 1D+0 penalty to any Pilot or Drive checks. Additionally, the feeling of weightlessness sets off your motion sickness, and you suffer a 0D+2 penalty to any action made in zero-gravity.
