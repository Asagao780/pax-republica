Minor implies that your addiction(s) don’t control your life, if you have to give them up then you are able to do it. Sweets might be hard to forego but if you have to do it, you can - so you don’t have that Corellian pastry everyday. That occasional sniff of spice or extra drink seems to keep you on keel, you are just being social, right?
