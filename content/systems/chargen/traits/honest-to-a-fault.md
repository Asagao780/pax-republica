You are the person that tells their spouse that their clothes make their backside look fat when they ask how they look in new clothes. Definitely not someone suited to diplomacy or politics, telling the truth is a burning necessity for you, making you simultaneously very trustworthy and a liability. Furthermore, in order to resist the urge tell someone the truth of a situation, regardless of its social implications, you must make a Moderate or better Willpower roll, at the GM's discretion.

You automatically gain a penalty against any attempt to lie or deceive, regardless of which skill is being used. A penalty of -OD+02 to Con, Persuade, Lead and Intimidate and even Bargain, depending on the situation.

Roll a difficult or better Willpower and you manage to offer an acceptable platitude. Fail the roll, and you must flatly inform your spouse that she has an ass the size of Coruscant and the pants don't make a difference.
