You are an indomitable spirit. Nothing will deter you from following a decision or accomplishing a goal. Implacable in the face of all obstacles, you stick to the course, sometimes to the harm of others if they get in your way. You are difficult to scare at the best of times, and do not crack easily under intimidation, threat, or pressure.

You gain a 1D+0 bonus to all Willpower rolls.
