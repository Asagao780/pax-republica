Spur of the moment decisions can either land you in trouble or help you take advantage of opportunities. You might try to plan your next move but you feel more alive swimming in the moment and acting on your feelings. Some people would call that uninhibited others might call it rash. You prefer to rely on luck than on the well-laid plan.
