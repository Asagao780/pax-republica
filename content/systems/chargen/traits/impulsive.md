Spur of the moment decisions can either land you in trouble or help you take advantage of opportunities. You might try to plan your next move but you feel more alive swimming in the moment and acting on your feelings. Some people would call that uninhibited others might call it rash. You prefer to rely on luck than on the well-laid plan.

You gain a 1D+0 bonus to initiative rolls, however you also take a 1D+0 penalty for the first action taken in combat or other spontaneous situations which would otherwise require forethought, planning, and tactical consideration, at the GM's discretion. After the first round of combat, you roll normally. For example, a fight breaks out in a bar. You roll initiative with a 1D+0 bonus, but you take a 1D+0 penalty to Brawl when you throw your first punch, because you didn't take any time to plan your attack.
