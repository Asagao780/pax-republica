When other people are bent over in agony, you can push through the pain. This is real asset for a spy or shock fighter because you might not break under torture or stay longer in the ring than your adversary. +1D to stamina rolls when under painful duress.

You gain a 1D+0 bonus to Toughness rolls to resist damage, a 1D+0 bonus to Stamina when exerting yourself past your physical comfort levels, and a 1D+0 bonus to Willpower for the purposes of perservering through pain and over-exertion. These bonuses cannot be applied if the character loses consciousness.
