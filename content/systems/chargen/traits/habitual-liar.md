Why live with the plain truth when you can embellish it? You lie about anything - your origins, education, abilities and intents and are more convincing about it than the average person. +1D to bluff rolls or convincing people that you are something that you arenâ€™t. A very good trait for a Con Man or Woman.

You must roll a moderate or better Willpower in order to resist the urge to lie when asked a question. In addition, you gain a 1D+0 bonus to Persuade or Con when lying. However, when a character doesn't believe your lie, or catches you in one, you suffer a 1D+0 penalty to Persuade or Con against that character for the duration of the scene.
