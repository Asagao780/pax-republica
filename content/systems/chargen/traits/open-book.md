You are a con artist's dream come true; a being who is unable to effectively hide their emotions, motives, and reactions. Others find you easy to read, either through your body language, facial expressions, or way of speaking. This makes you an exceptionally bad liar. You suffer a 1D+0 penalty to Con (and to Persuade when attempting to lie), as well as any attempt to conceal your true feelings from others who may probe, such as through Intimidate.
