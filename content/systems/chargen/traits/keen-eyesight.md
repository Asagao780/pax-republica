Whether through natural or artificial means, your powers of sight are considerably better than others of your species. Though you do not necessarily see in ways they cannot, you possess overall better visual acuity, range, depth perception, and ability to see detail. A handy trait for pilots, hunters, trackers, and investigators.

You gain a 1D+0 bonus to Search, and a 0D+1 bonus to any Awareness or Coordination skill roll where sight may be a determining factor, at the discretion of the GM.
