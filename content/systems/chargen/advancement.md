Character Advancement is accomplished by earning "noms" from your fellow players. Noms, short for "nominations" are awarded by players for excellent roleplay in a scene, and award two Character Points per nom received. There is no explanation required to give a nom, and no limit on the number of noms a player may award or receive in a week. A player who awards 5 or more noms in a week earns an additional two character points.

While there is no limit the number of noms a player may receive or award, there is a limit of 20 Character Points which a player may be awarded in a week from the +nom system. Staff-awarded Character Points do not count toward this limit.

In order to spend characters points to advance your skills, use the Character Advancement Terminal in Character Generation area. You may advance any number of skills at a time, however you may only advance a skill 1 pip (0D+1) per week, and skills may not be raised past 2D+0 over the racial attribute maximum for the associated skill; in order to raise a skill beyond that limit, submit a +request to staff explaining why your character should be able to increase his/her skill to the desired level.

For more information about how Character Points are used to raise skills, attributes, and force abilities, see [D6](/systems/d6).
