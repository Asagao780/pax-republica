The Reflex attribute represents your character's physical agility, dexterity, and finesse, as it relates to control over one's own body (as opposed to controlling other objects, as in Coordination). It represents your character's physical reaction time, as well as balance and flexibility. Characters with low Reflex may be clumsy or accident-prone. Archetypes which rely on Reflex include Bounty Hunter, Freedom Fighter, Mercenary, Scavenger, Smuggler, Soldier, Swoop Racer, and Thief.
