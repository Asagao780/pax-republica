Your characters skills determine how good you are at a given task, based on your level of both natural talent and training or practice. Skills are divided into their respective attributes, which determine their base level. In general, attributes represents natural talent or aptitude, while skills represent trained ability. For a more detailed explanation of how skill mechanics work, see the file on [D6](/systems/d6).
