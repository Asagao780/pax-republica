This is your character's ability to hurl an object or weapon with accuracy and power. This primarily applies to thrown weapons such as knives or spears, but also to grenades. This can apply to any object the character is physically capable of throwing, and the base difficulty will reflect the effectiveness of the object as a thrown weapon.
