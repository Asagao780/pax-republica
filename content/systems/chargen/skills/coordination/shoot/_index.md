The Shoot skill represents your character's ability to operate a character-scale blaster, firearm, or other ranged weapon with accuracy. When using the Shoot skill, the GM will determine a base difficulty to hit based on distance, cover, size, and environmental factors. The target may oppose your Shoot roll with Dodge.
