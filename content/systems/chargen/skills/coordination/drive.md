Drive represents your character's ability to operate ground-based vehicles (wheeled, tracked, legged, or hover), or boats, with precision and finesse. This does not apply to vehicles which operate in a three-dimensional plane, such as a starship, aerospace fighter, or submarine. This skill applies only to the driving operation, not necessarily the onboard equipment of the vehicle, which would be covered by Tech Operation or another more specific skill.
