Sneak is your character's ability to move or perform actions without drawing attention or being noticed. Sneak is opposed by Search, if your opponent is actively trying to find you, or Awareness if your opponent is not actively looking for you. Sneak is modified by environmental factors, as well as the complexity, speed, or obviousness of the action you wish to undertake.
