Your ability to hide, and remain hidden despite a thorough search. This differs from the Conceal skill in that it only applies to hiding yourself, not objects or other people. It also differs from Sneak in that it is intended to be used when your character is not moving or attempting to perform an action without being noticed; it is for keeping others, who may be searching for you, from finding you.
