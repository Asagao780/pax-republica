Track represents your character's ability to follow a person or animal across a long distance, despite terrain or environmental conditions (which may modify the difficulty target of the roll). It may be used in conjunction with Sneak in order to track without being noticed. If the target knows it is being tracked, it may oppose with Sneak or Hide, depending on how they are attempting to evade tracking. If the target does not know it is being tracked, the base difficulty will be determined by the GM.
