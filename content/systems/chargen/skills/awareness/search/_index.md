Your ability to consciously attempt to find, spot, or uncover an object or person in a given area. This does not include passive observation, which is a base Awareness check, only active searching. Search may be used at a distance as well as up close, depending on the scope of your search. It may be hindered or benefitted by environmental factors at the GM's discretion.
