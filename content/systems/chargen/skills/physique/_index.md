The Physique attribute represents your character's physical power and fortitude. It is the baseline from the Strength skill, which is used to determine striking, lifting, and throwing power. It is also the baseline for the Toughness skill, which determines how able you are to resist physical injuries. Archetypes which rely on the Physique attribute include Bounty Hunter, Freedom Fighter, Mercenary, and Soldier.
