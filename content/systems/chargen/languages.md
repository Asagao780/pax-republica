The number of languages your character speaks is based on the Language skill. Besides your race's native language, you may learn one language per 1D in the Language skill. Keep in mind that if your character's racial default language is not Basic, you'll need to pick it up if you want to understand the majority of beings in the Galaxy. As your Language skill increases, so does the number of languages you may speak.
