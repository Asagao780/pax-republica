The Jedi may call upon the Force to accelerate his healing, allowing him to recover from injuries rapidly. He must remain conscious in order to use this power, which requires at least two rounds of meditative focus to initiate, and one round per level of injury to be healed. This power must be re-rolled on each round once healing begins.

This power may be used on another being, at an increased difficulty of 10, modified by relationship. The Jedi must be able to make physical contact with the target in order to heal them.

**Difficulty:**

Wounded -> Healthy: 10

Severely Wounded -> Wounded: 15

Incapacitated -> Severely Wounded: 20

Mortally Wounded -> Incapacitated: 25

Dead: You're dead, there's no coming back from that.
