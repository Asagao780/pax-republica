The Jedi may call on the Force to show them possible future outcomes of immediate choices, and predict how events may unfold. However, as the future in always in motion and any number of events or actions may alter how it unfolds, any visions of the future are not guaranteed to be accurate. There is also the possibility of error or misinterpretation on the part of the Jedi. This power also allows for the revelation of object truths about a given situation, at the discretion of the GM.

Base Difficulty: 18
