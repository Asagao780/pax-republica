The Jedi may forcus her mind and attention on a single task or activity to the exclusion of all other considerations. This power requires one full round of meditative focus before it may be used. The player must state which skill to apply this to, and which action; a successful roll will allow the Jedi to add her Focus dice to the skill in question for a single round. Actions affected by this power must be single, one-round actions. At the GM's discretion, this power may be modified by external factors such as environment, or internal factors such as personal conflict or fear.

Base Difficulty: 15
