The Jedi is able to enter into a meditative trance for a specified number of rounds. Upon leaving the trance, the Jedi gains may add their Meditate skill dice as a pool to up to three skills in a single attribute, for twice as many rounds as they were in the trance for. For example, if the Jedi has 6D Meditation, and meditates for three rounds, she may add 2D to each of Search, Track, and Sneak for six rounds.

Base Difficulty: 15
