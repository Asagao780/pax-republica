Players may have one Force Sensitive character at any given time, subject to all other alternate character rules. This character will start with 1D+0 in the **Force** attribute, and be given 1D+0 to distribute to Force skills; any additional skills or attribute increases will come from the character's starting attribute or skill dice. This character may begin the game at Apprentice level (1D+0 Force) or Knight level (3D+0 Force), and may possess no more than six Force skills total.

A player's Force Sensitive character is not required to be a member of the Jedi Order, though there are conditions that come with _not_ being a member of the Order. Trained Force Users outside of the Jedi Order are considered restricted, and must have their concept approved by staff using the pre-approval process found in [Restricted Characters](/theme/characters/restricted). Be aware that in this age, the Jedi Council is extremely wary of Force traditions outside of their own Order, and while not actively hostile, are definitely not friendly toward them. The reactions of individual Jedi may of course vary from person to person, but the overall view of the Jedi on outsiders using the Force is not favourable.

Force Users are susceptible to picking up Dark Side Points for "dark" actions, thoughts, and feelings. Please read [Dark Side Points](/systems/chargen/force/dark-side-points) for more information on this. Dark Side Points can have long-term effects on your character, both in terms of RP, and your OOC ability to maintain control over your character's actions.

Force Using characters and the players who play them are generally held to a higher standard of, for lack of a better word, sportsmanship. We expect Force-using players to not only respect the rules of the game and their fellow players, but to be an positive example for new players. We do not require Force Users to take the place of staff, or to run constant events or plots, or to maintain activity at a certain level, however when online, Force User players should be encouraging of RP, helpful when possible, and set an excellent example for others. Players failing to adhere to this expectation will not be permitted to continue to play a Force User on this game.
