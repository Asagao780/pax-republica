The Jedi may use the Force to see events occuring in distant locations, or in the past. This power cannot be used to predict future events; see [Force Insight](/systems/chargen/force/force-insight).

This power requires no less than 3 rounds of meditative focus, and is modified by proximity, amount of time elapsed since the event, and relationship (if the Farsight power is focused on another being).

Base Difficulty: 15
