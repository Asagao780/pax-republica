When a Jedi has earned a Dark Side Point, they may attempt to cleanse their spirit and remove it. The act of Atonement is long and difficult, as the Dark Side wishes nothing more than to maintain its grip on a potential servant.

Atonement takes one full day per the Jedi's total Dark Side Points to remove a single point. So if you have four Dark Side Points, it takes four days of meditation and spiritual cleansing to remove one point. During this meditation, the Jedi cannot perform any other actions, and any interruption will force them to start again from the beginning.

While Atoning for their misdeeds, the Jedi will be wracked with visions and torment from the Dark Side, and will be required to make one successful Willpower roll per day for each of their total Dark Side Points. This roll will be made against a die code totalling their Dark Side Points combined with their half their Force attribute dice. For example, if the Jedi has 4 Dark Side Points, and 4D+0 Force, they must roll their Willpower against 6D+0 in order to be successful, and the Jedi must succeed in this roll four times in order to remove one Dark Side Point. If a roll is failed, the Jedi may attempt a saving roll at 1D+0 greater difficulty.

The Jedi must complete the Atonement process for every Dark Side Point they possess; only when the Jedi no longer possesses any Dark Side Points will their penalties and bonuses be removed entirely.
