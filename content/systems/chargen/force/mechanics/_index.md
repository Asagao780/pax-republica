For Force Users, the **Force** attribute is the base stat for all powers and abilities, which are treated in a similar manner to skills. Force Users are given 1D+0 **Force**, and 1D+0 to allot to Force skills in CharGen, at no additional cost. If desired, the player may allot a portion of their starting attribute and skill dice to **Force** or its associated skills.

After CharGen, players may raise their **Force** attribute at a cost of 15xD up to 6D+0, and 20xD after that. For example, to raise **Force** from 1D+0 to 1D+1, the cost is 15CP. To raise it from 2D+0 to 2D+1, the cost is 30CP. To raise **Force** from 6D+0 to 6D+1, the cost is 120CP. This increased cost is intended to make Force progression slower and more deliberative; it takes decades of training for a Jedi to become a Master, and the increased cost should reflect that.

In addition, Force skills cost 2xD to raise from one pip to the next. For example, to raise a Force skill from 1D+0 to 1D+1, the cost is 2CP. To raise it from 4D+0 to 4D+1, the cost is 8CP. Again, the intention is for Force progression to be more difficult. Force skills may not be used untrained (unlike regular skills, which can be rolled at their base attribute level), and Force skills cannot be raised without training by an an IC individual or other learning apparatus (holocron, intense study at the Jedi library, etcetera). All Force raises must have an IC justification and roleplay to back it up. There are no exceptions to this.
