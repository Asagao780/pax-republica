A Jedi may use the Force to deflect incoming energy attacks, allowing her to safely redirect blaster fire or Force Lightning. This power may be used without a lightsaber; if used with a lightsaber, add the Melee and Deflect dice to roll for a total value. The Jedi may use this multiple times per round, suffering the usual multiple action penalties. 

The base difficulty for this power is the Shoot (or Summon Lightning) roll of the attacking player. To redirect the attack to a specific target, add 10 to the base difficulty. 

This power cannot be used to defend against ambient energies, only directed energy attacks. It will not save a Jedi from the heat of a volcano, for example.
