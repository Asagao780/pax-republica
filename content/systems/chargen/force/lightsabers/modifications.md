When constructing a lightsaber, a Jedi may opt to include certain non-standard features in the hilt of the blade. While these modification cannot increase the damage the lightsaber is capable of inflicting, they may have other aesthetic or practical effects. Because these modifications are part of the physical casing, they are installed using the Weapon Repair skill, rather than Jedi Lore.

**Variable Length**: For each additional length setting for the lightsaber blade, the roll a Difficult Weapon Repair.

**Cell Recognizer**: Add a small sensor array (800 credits) and recognition chip (350 credits) to the handle of the saber, which reads the cell pattern of the wielder. If the cell pattern does not match its list of recognized users, the weapon shuts down and any failsafe devices are activated (electric shock, audio alarm, alert via comlink, etcetera). An additional Difficult Weapon Repair roll is required to install this feature.

**Pressure Grip**: Added to the handle of the lightsaber, this allows a 'dead man' switch on the blade. The lightsaber activates and deactivates as normal, but automatically deactivates when the pressure on the handle is removed. The pressure sensor itself costs an additional 600 credits, but no additional difficulty roll is required.

**Call Beacon**: Install a small device into the lightsaber handle which will trigger a slave circuit like a regular call beacon, in order to summon or activate a starship in range. Requires an additional Moderate Lightsaber Tech roll to install, and costs an additional 1000 credits for the component.

*Water-Proof Casing*: Add a secondary waterproof casing to the handle of the lightsaber in order to protect the power cell from damage by submersion in water; without this a Jedi must remove the power cell before travelling underwater, or risk damage to the weapon. The casing costs 200 credits, but no additional difficulty roll is required.

**Translator Unit**: Include a small droid translator unit and vocabulator with a built-in earpiece for discreet use, allowing the Jedi to translate languages he may not otherwise understand. Requires an additional moderate Lightsaber Tech roll, and costs 1000 credits for parts.

**Trapped Handle**: Typically used by Dark Jedi, some lightsabers have special traps in their handles to prevent unauthorized use, often triggered by a cell recognizer. This can be anything from spikes or blades which burst from the handle to deal damage to the user, or electrocution, or poison. The only limit is your evil imagination. The cost of this varies, depending on the type of trap, and installation increases the difficulty of the Lightsaber Tech roll by two levels.
