The Jedi may use the power of the Force to lift, push, pull, or crush physical objects without touching them. Finer application can manipulate individual components of a system, constrict a being's airway, or affect their individual organs. This power is modified by the size and mass of the target, as well as proximity. This power is not specifically a Dark Side Power, however using it to cause direct harm may result in a Dark Side Point.

Base Difficulty: 5
