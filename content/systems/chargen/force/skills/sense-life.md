The Jedi is able to sense the presence of life through the Force, and glean information about that life. The Jedi can use this power to not only detect if life forms are present, but gain information about species, health, age, Force Sensitivity, and general proximity and direction. This power can be used to target specific groups or individuals for the purpose of tracking. It is modified by proximity and relationship, and opposed by Conceal; only Force Users may actively resist this power.

Base Difficulty: 15
