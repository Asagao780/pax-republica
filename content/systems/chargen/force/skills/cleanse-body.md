A Jedi may call upon the Force to cleanse his body of toxins, disease, parasites, or other foreign contaminants. This requires at least two rounds of meditative focus, or more at the discretions of the GM based on the strength of the substance to be cleansed.

This power may be used on others, increasing the base difficulty by 10, modified by relationship, and the Jedi must be able to make physical contact with the target.

Base Difficulty: Determined by GM based on toxin/disease.
