The Jedi may use this power to influence or manipulate the mind and will of another being, placing telepathic suggestions or instructions using the power of the Force. While not a Dark Side power specifically, using this power for dishonest or harmful means is likely to earn a Dark Side Point. This power is directly opposed by the target's Willpower. This power will last as many rounds as the Jedi's Influence roll exceeds the target's Willpower roll.

Base Difficulty: 10
