The Jedi may draw on the power of the Force to fortify the user's willpower, adding Enhance Will dice to the Willpower skill. This power may be kept up for as many rounds as the user has dice in Enhance Will, decreasing by 1D+0 each round it is kept up; if the Jedi has 4D+* Enhance Will, it may be maintained for 4 rounds. The Jedi may perform other actions while the power is active, at a penalty of 1D+0 per additional action. If the Jedi's combined Enhance Will and Willpower roll are beaten by a target, a 1D penalty to Willpower is suffered for as many rounds as the Jedi has dice in Enhance Will. The Jedi will not be able to use Enhance Will again for the same number of rounds.

Base Difficulty: 10
