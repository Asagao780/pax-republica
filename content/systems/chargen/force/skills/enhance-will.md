The Jedi may draw on the power of the Force to fortify her willpower, adding her Enhance Will dice to her Willpower skill. This power may be kept up for as many rounds as she has dice in Enhance Will, decreasing by 1D+0 each round it is kept up; if the Jedi has 4D+* Enhance Will, she may keep it up for 4 rounds. The Jedi may perform other actions while keeping this power up, at a penalty of 1D+0 per additional action. If the Jedi's combined Enhance Will and Willpower roll are beaten by a target, she will suffer a 1D penalty to Willpower for as many rounds as she has dice in Enhance Will, and not be able to use Enhance Will for the same number of rounds.

Base Difficulty: 10
