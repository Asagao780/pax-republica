The Jedi may use the Force to mentally communicate with others, read or project thoughts, as well as manipulate memories and emotions. This power is modified by proximity and relationship. While not specifically a Dark Side power, telepathy can be used in some nasty ways; using this power for selfish means, or to cause harm to another being may result in a Dark Side Point at the discretion of the GM.

Base Difficulty: 10
