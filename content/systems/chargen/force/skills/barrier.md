A Jedi may call upon the Force to create a powerful energy barrier to protect herself and others from physical attacks. The barrier's total health pool is the value of the initial roll. An attack on any target within the barrier must first exceed the barrier's total health pool; if it does not, the barrier maintains its full health. If the attack exceeds the barrier's health, the target within suffers the difference, resisted by their own Toughness roll, and the barrier is broken. If the barrier is broken, the Jedi may not act for one turn, and may not use this power again for two turns.

The Jedi may expand the Barrier to encompass multiple targets, increasing the base difficulty by 5 for each additional target.

This power may be kept "up" for as many rounds as the Jedi has dice in the skill; if the Jedi's Barrier skill is 4D+*, she may keep the Barrier up for 4 rounds before re-rolling. When these rounds are up, the Jedi must wait one full round before attempting to use this power again.

Base difficulty: 10
