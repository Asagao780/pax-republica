The Jedi may focus her mind and attention on a single task or activity to the exclusion of all other considerations. This power requires one full round of meditative focus before it may be used. The player must state which skill to apply this to, and which action; a successful roll will allow the Jedi to add her Focus dice to the skill in question for a single round. Actions affected by this power must be single, one-round actions. At the GM's discretion, this power may be modified by external factors such as environment, or internal factors such as personal conflict or fear.

Example:

Qui-Gon Jinn is fighting Darth Maul. There is a moment where ray shielding prevents either combatant from engaging, during which time Qui-Gon uses the Focus power, meditating on his Melee skill. He rolls a 20 for his Focus power. When the shield goes down, Qui-Gon is able to re-engage Maul, and rolls a 25 on his Melee skill, resulting in a total of 45. In order to counter that attack, Maul must roll greater than 45 on his own Melee roll to defend.
