The Jedi is able to enter into a meditative trance for a specified number of rounds. Upon leaving the trance, the Jedi may add her Meditate roll divided equally among up to three skills in a single attribute, for twice as many rounds as she was in the trance for. For example, if the Jedi rolls a 15 on Meditation, and meditates for three rounds, she may add 5 to each of Search, Track, and Sneak for six rounds.

Base Difficulty: 15
