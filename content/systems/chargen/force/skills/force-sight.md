The Jedi may use the Force to sense her physical surroundings and interpret them as a mental image, allowing her to "see" in darkness or other visibility-limiting conditions. This power may be kept up for as many rounds as the Jedi has dice in Force Sight; if she has 4D+* Force Sight, she may keep it up for 4 rounds before re-rolling, without additional penalties.

This power may be modified by external factors which affect a Jedi's concentration, such as a fire, extreme cold, or active combat.

Base Difficulty: 10
