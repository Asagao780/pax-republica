The Jedi may use the Force to temporarily shield herself, others, or an object from sight. The difficulty to use this power is modified by size and distance; if used to conceal living beings, add 5 to the total difficulty for each additional being. This power must be re-rolled every turn to be kept up, and the concealing Jedi may not perform any other actions besides movement while keeping the power up. If moving while using this power, increase the difficulty by 5. If an outside observer is actively looking for items or beings hidden by this power, their Search roll must exceed the power roll by no less than 10.

Base Difficulty: 10 (15 if concealing herself)
