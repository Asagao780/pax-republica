The Jedi may channel the Dark Side of the Force to create powerful blasts of tainted electrical energy, and direct them at a target. Force Lightning causes intense physical and psychological damage to the target; it may be defended against using Deflect in order to mitigate the physical effects, but any target of this power must also roll Willpower and exceed half the power roll or suffer 2D+0 additional damage, and a 1D+0 Willpower penalty for the next two rounds. This power ignores armor, and is modified by proximity.

Using Summon Lightning under any circumstance automatically awards a Dark Side Point.

Base Difficulty: 15
