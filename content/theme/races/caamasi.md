The Caamasi are a mammalian species of furry humanoids known for their compassionate and peace-loving nature; indeed, the name Caamasi came to mean "friend from afar" and "stranger to be trusted" in some languages across the galaxy. Their fur is a dense grey or brown color with a spicy, woody body scent that may remind some of Corellian whiskey.
They sport two, long arms with thin, three-fingered hands and two pointed ears that stick out from the sides of their heads. They also have an acute sense of smell, with a nose positioned at the end of a toothy snout.

Caamasi have the ability to share vivid memories called *memnii* with their near relatives and Force-sensitives. A *memnis* was as vivid to one who receives it as it was to the one who was directly involved in the event in the memory. Their peace-loving natures are indeed partially due to the *memnii*, as having a memory of killing or harming would be particularly strong, becoming unbearable in time. Therefore, it is something Caamasi would seek to avoid except in defense of themselves or others, for which case they would accept the burden.
