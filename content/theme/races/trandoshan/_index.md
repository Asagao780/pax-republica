"Judging by the skull shape and number of teeth, these appear to be Trandoshans. They are fierce warriors and are tough to kill."

Trandoshans are sentient humanoids with smooth, scaly skin hailing from the planet Trandosha. They are powerful beings with advancing healing factor, able to regenerate entire limbs such as their long thin arms that end in either three thick digits, or four thin digits including a thumb. Their eyes are set back on a pointed skull, and their jaws are filled with pointed canines. Trandoshans often walk barefooted, with three-digit feet. A Trandoshan's skin color may vary widely, including green, red, orange, brown, or yellow tones. Trandoshans use their sharp claws to climb tall trees in the forest or jungles they naturally inhabit.

Culturally, Trandoshans are known for placing high value on hunting skills, and many relish the thrill of a good hunt.
