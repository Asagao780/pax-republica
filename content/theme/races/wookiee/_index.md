Wookiees are a tall species of furry giants from the planet Kashyyyk, who have been known to grow to a height of nearly three meters. They are covered from head to toe in a thick, shaggy coat of hair with water resistant properties that mostly come in shades of brown, black, gray, and white. Males grow long beards in adult life. Wookiee eye color ranges from blue to brown. Wookiees are big eaters, with the average adult needing to 3,500-6,000 calories of food per day.

A Wookie possesses extendable claws used mainly for climbing. Despite their fearsome appearance and volatile temperament, Wookiees are typically regarded as intelligent, sophisticated, loyal and trusting. When angered, Wookiees are known to descend into a berserker rage. Wookiees have a long lifespan, appearing not to age over a span of fifty years. They are capable of comprehending other languages, but are physically unable to speak them.
