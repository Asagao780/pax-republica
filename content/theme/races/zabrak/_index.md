Zabraks are a near-human carnivorous species native to the planet Iridonia. The species have a distinctive ring of horns atop their heads and two hearts. Zabraks were considered to be proud, self-determined, and even arrogant to some, and are one of the most independent species in the galaxy. They have evolved to be rather tough due to the nature of their homeworld Iridonia. Zabraks are carnivorous and possess two hearts, allowing them to pump oxygenated blood around their systems more quickly than other species, giving them heightened speed and stamina. Most Zabraks are characterized by a ring of small, vestigial horns that run from high on the brow round to the back of the head, with the horns of males generally being more developed than those of females. Horn placement, length and thickness may vary widely between individuals.
