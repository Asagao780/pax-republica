However alien their ecosystems may be from each other, all living creatures encompass both creative and destructive impulses. Just as birth is just as much a part of life as 
death is, the Force also has a dual nature with aspects of both creation and destruction. Sentient beings have been aware of this division ever since they began accessing the 
Force; for it is an inherent part of its nature. Names were given to these opposed sides, inspired by a basic understanding of the most intuitive of relationships: that between 
light and dark.

Those who draw upon the light side know it by the feelings that invite its presence: peace, understanding, compassion, and even love. Its use is typically tied to selfless
actions and intentions that are based upon preserving life and its sanctity. For those who have gained the deepest understanding, wielding the light side is not so much about 
imposing their own will as it is about allowing the will of the Cosmic Force to shape destiny.

The strength of the dark side rushes in from raw emotion. Fear, anger, jealousy, and hatred are all conduits for the power of the dark side. It is most effectively bent to the 
will of the wielder when used for destructive actions and focused by unchecked passion and burning desire.

The Jedi and the Sith, the major Force-wielding traditions of the galaxy, each developed following the path of one side while completely exluding the other. Their exact 
origins are ancient and mysterious; however, what is known is that they have remained diametrically opposed enemies of each other throughout galactic history. For this reason, 
some believe that the creation of the Jedi and the Sith in the distant past is the embodiment of the opposition between the light and dark sides of the Force. Another deeply
held belief about the Force is evidenced by the waxing and waning of each side's power and influence over the years--the believe that the Force has a balance, and that this 
balance can shift over time.

While Force-sensitive beings such as the Jedi and the Sith have the greatest influence over the balance of the Force, it is worth noting that they are not the only ones who are 
capable of interacting with it, even if they are among the few with the ability to manipulate it. All sentient beings can choose to act in a way that either destroys or preserves 
life. Most view their actions (or lack thereof) within the scope of their own personal convictions, whether these are influenced by cultural or family beliefs or not. This does 
not mean that the Force has not acted upon them, or that their actions do not affect the balance between light and dark. By embracing one side over the other, they are
actively engaging in the eternal conflict between the light and the dark.
