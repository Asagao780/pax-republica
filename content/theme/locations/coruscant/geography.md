Coruscant's surface is a massive ecumenopolis, a planet-spanning city called Galactic City. Dense city blocks built on top of one another, encompassing thousands of levels built up over generations. Its highest level is a maze of tall skyscrapers, sky-speeder routes, and sleek transperisteel structures standing next to and above the older duracrete buildings. The lower one descends through the levels of Galactic City, the more stark the difference in economic class; the upper levels belong to the wealthy elite, while those below live in increasing poverty. The lowest levels are barely habitable, if at all, and rumors of mutated creatures who may have once been human living in the darkness below have persisted through generations.
