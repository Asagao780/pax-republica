Jedha is a moon in the orbit of the planet NaJedha, in the Jedha system of the galaxy's Mid Rim, due galactic west of the Deep Core. It is a small desert moon characterized by jagged rock formations, broad mesas, narrow spires, and rocky dustbowls. The moon has a cold climate and a sandstone crust rich with deposits of kyber crystals. Many settlements on the moon, such as the ancient Holy City, are built upon the world's natural mesas. Though Jedha's sands remain parched for much of its year, there are some powerful torrents of rainfall, a cause for celebration among the people of Jedha.

Jedha's ancient structures are some of the earliest examples of architecture known to exist in the galaxy.
