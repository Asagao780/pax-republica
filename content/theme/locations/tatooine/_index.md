Tatooine is located in the Outer Rim. It is orbited by three moons: Ghomrassen, Guermessa and Chenini.[3] Long ago, Tatooine was covered in oceans and rainforests, but for unknown reasons, it became a hot desert world.[2] Tatooine orbits twin suns, Tatoo I and Tatoo II.[3][1] The whole planet is covered in harsh deserts, and only a small part of its northern hemisphere can sustain intelligent life.[32] The landscape was covered with sand dunes, mountains, and canyons, which made traversing the planet very difficult. Due to the absence of surface water, those who lived on Tatooine had to draw moisture through the dry air.[33]

Native species include the carnivorous krayt dragons, bantha, eopies, dewbacks, rontos, womp rats, massiffs and scurriers. The common krayt dragon, while more plentiful, is shadowed by the greater krayt dragon, which submerged itself under the shifting sands and used its powerful limbs to swim through the dunes. 

The cities of Tatooine are frequently blasted by sandstorms. Not much distinguished the towns as the poor standard of living is common. The cities are separated from each other by large expanses of deserts. Rural life, on the other hand, was mostly small moisture farms that sell water and food for a meager living.
Points of Interest
Mos Espa 
Mos Espa is Tatooine’s largest city. The city is entirely controlled by the Hutts and their criminal syndicates, while the vast majority of citizens are poor individuals just trying to
get by. Even less fortunate are the slaves housed in old mining quarters on the outskirts of town.

Most of the city is built out of weathered natural stone and similar materials; most buildings have a domed roof and few or no windows. The streets are a winding maze with few markers or formal organization. There is no meaningful distinction between legal trade and what other cities would consider black markets. Sandstorms are a regular threat that can shut
down the city with little warning.

Beyond Tatooine, Mos Espa is known for the spectacular podraces held at the Grand Arena just outside of town. Podracers from across the Outer Rim and beyond pit their skills against each other and the fantastically dangerous racecourse. Most spectators watch the race from an enormous grandstand. Gambling on races is one of Mos Espa’s primary economic gains, so the Hutts are intent upon maintaining their control over the events.

Mos Eisley Spaceport
Mos Eisley spaceport is a large, bustling place with ships constantly arriving and departing at over three hundred landing pads around the city. All manner of goods both legal and illicit can be found for sale somewhere in town. The city's cantinas and bazaars are popular meeting places for those seeking to move cargo or passengers. Mos Eisley's buildings are typical for the world--low to the ground with domed roofs or open-top landing bays.
