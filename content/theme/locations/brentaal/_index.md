Brentaal IV is located at the intersection of the Hydian Way and the Perlemian Trade Route, which
makes it one of the most vital trade hubs in the entire galaxy. Brentaalâ€™s warehouse district features massive facilities of major corporations across the galaxy. It has a rocky surface and at least one moon can be seen in its sky. Brentaal IV has long been a major commerce hub, due to its location along the Perlemian Trade Route, and much of its culture is focused around commerce and economics.

## History
Brentaal IV was an early, but not founding member of the Old Galactic Republic, quickly establishing its importance as a trade hub with the mapping of the Perlemian Trade Route. The planetary government is run more like a corporation than a nation, under the control of the Brentaal Houses -- merchant families which operate the planet's trade and shipping industries.

## Geography
Brentaal IV is a rocky world composed of small continents separated by large salty oceans. The majority of land on Brentaal is covered with urban sprawl; precious little of Brentaal's landmass was ever arable, and it has always relied on agri-worlds from which to import food for its large population.

## Points of Interest
### Cormond
#### Cormond Trade Hall
The Trade Hall in Cormond is the center of Brentaal's commercial interests. The lower floors house expansive trading floors, and thousands of offices, gardens, and shopping centers. It also houses its own small spaceport, though berthing costs are steep; a mark of prestige for those who can afford to pay the fees. The upper floors of the Trade Hall are home to the Brentaal Houses' council chambers and conference rooms, where the affairs of the planetary government are conducted.
