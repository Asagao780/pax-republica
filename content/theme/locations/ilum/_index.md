Situated in the eponymous star system located in a part of the Unknown Regions known as the 7G sector, Ilum is smaller than a dwarf planet. However, due to its kyber crystalline core and a frigid climate, it is considered a planet despite its diminutive size. The planet is inhospitable to most species due to its icy terrain, however it is populated by some non-sentient animals.

Hidden beneath Ilum's frigid surface is the Crystal Cave. Kyber crystals grow within the frigid labyrinth, bringing the Jedi Order to the frozen wasteland to harvest the crystals in a rite of passage known as the Gathering. Jedi initiates harvest their crystals from the cave by attuning themselves to the Force. 

Also located beneath the surface of Ilum are geysers, formed by volcanic activity on the planet. These geysers often warm some bodies of water under the ice, although their size or duration are subject to change due to volcanic episodes or mineral deposition. Geological formations are also present in the caves of the planet, formed over billions of years by accumulated mineral matter deposited by hydrothermal fluids.
