Naboo is a lush, green and blue world dotted with cities and towns that feature many gardens and formal-looking architecture. While the surface is ruled by humans who colonized the planet thousands of years ago, its expansive oceans and marshlands are inhabited mainly by the native Gungans. Surprisingly, the planet does not have a molten core like many other planets of its type, but sports a plasma core that has burned many caverns and labyrinths into the lower layers of rock.

Naboo has been an active part of the Republic for centuries. Although the humans and Gungans local governance is handled separately, it is represented by a single Senator in the Galactic Senate. 

It is orbited by three moons: Ohma D’un, Rori, and Veruna. These are mainly home to small colonies and industrial sectors. 
Points of Interest
Theed
Naboo's dramatic capital city features formal architecture surrounded by waterways and
grasslands. The artful, domed structures extend along a massive waterfall on the banks of the Solleu River. The city is home to the expansive Theed Royal Palace, which sits on the towering Cliffs of Theed.

Below lies the city's busy spaceport. Immediately adjacent to the palace is the Plasma Refinery Complex, drawing plasma directly from the planet’s core for power generation and export. Theed University is a prestigious learning center for politics, law, and civic studies.
Otoh Gunga
The Gungans’ largest city has over a million inhabitants. Located deep under Lake Paonga, Otoh Gunga resembles a sprawling cluster of glowing bubbles, many of which contain a variety of smaller bubbles within. Due to the city's depth, little sunlight reaches it, leaving the ambient glow of these structures as the only reliable source of light.

The city is largely contained in the hydrostatic bubbles created by the Gungans. The force-field technology displaces water and prevents objects from entering anywhere except at specific entry points. Each area of the city is contained within one or more hydrostatic bubbles; collectively, these areas are known as Otoh Villages.
