Alderaan is a world of varied terrain and climates, with grasslands, mountain ranges, and scattered inland seas dotting its surface. In many ways, Alderaan seems at times too perfect to have been natural, but there is no evidence to suggest otherwise. Alderaanian cities are constructed with great care taken to protect the natural world; even their architecture is designed to minimize environmental impact. The capital city of Aldera is built on a small island in the center of a caldera. The planet possessed no large oceans separating its continents, the majority of its surface water composed of thousands of interconnecting lakes and waterways.
