**Aldera**

The capital city of Alderaan is a work of art in and of itself, an island in the center of a large lake, in view of the Triplehorn Mountains. Aldera is home to the Aldera Royal Palace, the University of Alderaan, the Aldera Universal Medcenter, dozens of museums and galleries, and some of the finest eateries in the known galaxy.
