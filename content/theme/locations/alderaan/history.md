Alderaan was an early signatory of the Galactic Constitution which formed the Old Galactic Republic. It was instrumental, along with Coruscant, in the early development of the Republic, and contributed immensely to early expansion and colonization efforts. Over the thousands of years of the Republic's existence, Alderaanians became more concerned with matters of art, culture, and knowledge, eschewing war and violence; while its planetary defense forces were equal to any in the Core Worlds, Alderaan became known as a planet of pacifists and idealists. Alderaan is known to have produced many Jedi Masters over the millenia, all of whom have carried their homeworld's peaceful nature with them into the Order.
