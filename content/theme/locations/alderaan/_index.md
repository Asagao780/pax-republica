Located in the Core Worlds, Alderaan is a peaceful, lush world covered by oceans, mountains, and forests. It is considered the art and cultural centre of the Galactic Republic, practically a mandatory pilgrimmage for artists, philosophers, and academics from all corners of civilized space. Alderaan was one of the original founding members of the Old Republic, and contributed greatly to its reformation after the Sith Wars. As such, Alderaan is an important political figure in the Galactic Senate, with many smaller systems looking to Alderaan as an example in matters of policy and sentient rights.
