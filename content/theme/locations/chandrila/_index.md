A small blue-green planet with calm seas and rolling hills, Chandrila has mild seasonal weather and rarely experiences dangerous environmental conditions. Its capital is Hanna City, a beautiful city located on the shores of the Silver Sea. A founder of the Republic and its very first agriworld, Chandrila is an idyllic paradise committed to democracy, peace, and harmony with nature. Chandrilaâ€™s gardens in the Gladean State Parks are beloved throughout the galaxy.

## History

Chandrila was one of the original signatories of the Galactic Constitution which formed the old Galactic Republic, and as such has had a place in galactic politics since the dawn of the Republic, and its reformation. It has been an agricultural world since its initial settlement, and in its entire history has never suffered a recorded ecological disaster; all manufactured goods are imported from off-world, and the lack of heavy industry is an important factor in Chandrila's environmental balance.
