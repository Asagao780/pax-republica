Corellia is home to the Corellian Engineering Corporation, a popular shipbuilder that produces fast, customizable ships. Corellia has also achieved a measure of infamy for the wanderlust of its natives. Many have gone on to become heroes or outlaws, and sometimes both.

The planet is located in the Corellian sector in the Core Worlds. Its climate is temperate, and its terrain consists mostly of jungles and urban centers. Its capital city is Coronet City, home to many shipyards used to build all sorts of spacecraft used throughout the galaxy. Many explorers intent upon mapping new hyperspace routes and assisting in colonization efforts on behalf of the Republic hail from Corellia.
