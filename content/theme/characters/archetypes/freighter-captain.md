Freighter captains are in charge of a ship and crew responsible for moving cargo from planet to planet and sector to sector. Some work independently, while others may be under the umbrella of a larger organization or corporation. They usually have extensive knowledge of freighter ships and their inner workings, as well as all the major galactic trade routes. Good captains also have the respect of their crews.
