A Grizzled Veteran was once a soldier of some kind, but has retired from the fight, usually due to age taking its toll on the body. However, with age comes experience and wisdom, both of which make these old soldiers invaluable for their insight on almost every battle needing won. Younger, high-ranking officers often seek the advice of veterans when finding themselves up against seemingly insurmountable odds.
