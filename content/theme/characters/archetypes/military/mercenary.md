A professional soldier, sometimes called a soldier of fortune, a mercenary is paid for his service to fight in wars and battles which, besides the money, have nothing to do with him. Often, mercenaries work alone or with a small team, and some mercenaries also work at Bounty Hunters, though the guild frowns on such things; mercenaries don't usually have the same sensibilities when it comes to killing their targets. Mercenaries are often hired by private citizens as bodyguards, or in some circumstances consultants.
