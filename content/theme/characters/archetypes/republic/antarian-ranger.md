The Antarian Rangers are an elite group of non-Force users who have dedicated themselves to the service of the Jedi Order. Whether it's going in ahead of time to perform recon, fighting alongside them, or digging up vital intel, these brave fighters will do whatever is needed in service of the noble cause of the Jedi. Many of them are individuals who failed or were rejected for Jedi training, but still had a desire to maintain a connection with the Force and fight for the Order in some way. However, there are also quite a few non-Force sensitives who are simply highly dedicated to the Order's ideals and wish to devote their entire lives to serving them.
