Senate Guards patrol the Senate Rotunda, ensuring that order is kept; particularly during important sessions. Protecting Senators, the Chancellor and other Senate staff is of utmost importance. These guards are usually on duty around the Senate Plaza on Coruscant, but may be assigned to bodyguard duty for a particular Senator during an offworld visit.
