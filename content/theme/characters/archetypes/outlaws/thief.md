A thief is as its name implies--someone who takes what is not his, whether it's money, materials, or even people. This type of work usually requires a high level of stealth for slipping past undetected, or being able to trick others into believing lies. And in the case of getting caught...having a quick way of either evading arrest or if necessary, fending off pursuers.
