"Spice, in any of its dozens of varieties, was a plague on the galaxy; a horribly addicting drug that its victims would lie, steal, assault, and murder for."

Spice dealers buy and sell spice, fueling addictions to illicit substances all across the galaxy. The spice trade is widespread, even operating among Core worlds although it is far more rampant in the Outer Rim. In either case, it is a highly profitable yet often dangerous business due to the fact that it operates outside Republic law and its patrons may become violent if desperate enough.
