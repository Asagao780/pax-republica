Card sharks make money by winning at card games, whether it's simply through sheer skill and experience over less seasoned players, or by cheating and getting away with it. Even if they are not always technically cheaters, they are usually out to take advantage over the hapless and guillable in some way. As such, they are good at putting on a show with the aim of tricking others into believing fallacies.
