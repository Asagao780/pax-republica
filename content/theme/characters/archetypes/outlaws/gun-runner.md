A gun runner's business is the illicit trade of contraband weapons and ammunition. These individuals often serve larger criminal organizations, but can sometimes operate independently. As with many careers of an illegal nature, gunrunning is both highly profitable and highly dangerous, as powerful criminals are not often kind to those who cross them.
