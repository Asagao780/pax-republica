When the Order has need of effective negotiations with other parties or entities, it turns to the Jedi Consular. Consulars are wise visionaries who excel in diplomacy as much as they do in combat. Their cunning insight allows them to seek and find even the most carefully veiled truths, and their gifts in foresight provide them with the advantage of anticipating an enemy's next move before it is carried out.
