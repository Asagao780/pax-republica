A Personal Guard is usually employed by someone wealthy who has the money to pay for a bodyguard to follow them around and ensure their safety wherever they set foot. Bodyguards are equipped to handle any threat a client may face, from pickpocketing to assassination. Working as a personal guard is sometimes a dangerous line of work, as a bodyguard may often be expected to put his or her life on the line for the sake of the employer.
