summary: Capture by design, kill by necessity. Bounty Hunters track and capture targets across the galaxy at the behest of their employers; their independence from official Republic authorities gives them the freedom to track and apprehend their targets in any jurisdiction. The Guild offers many benefits to Hunters, for a small percentage of their bounty; the Guild helps match Hunters with targets, handles permits and licenses, and other legal matters are all quietly dealt with by Guild agents, allowing the Hunter to focus on what he does best -- Hunt.

The Bounty Hunters Guild or simply “the Guild” is a group of mercenaries and bounty hunters that operates primarily in the Outer Rim. Guild leaders gather pucks from clients and determine assignments, although most members handle the jobs themselves alone. While individual bounty hunters receive the bulk of the payment for each job, the Guild does take a cut, which must be agreed upon before any hunter joins. Additionally, one must prove his prowess as a bounty hunter to be worthy of membership in the Guild. 

**Bounty Hunter's Creed**

No bounty is worth dying for.

People don't have bounties. Only acquisitions have bounties.

Capture by design, kill by necessity.

No hunter shall slay another hunter.

In the hunt one captures or kills, never both.

No hunter shall refuse aid to another hunter.
