summary: Far from the Core Worlds, the Hutt Clans control a large swath of territory from their capital of Nal Hutta, outside of the control of the Galactic Republic. In Hutt Space, the only laws are those the Hutts themselves care to enforce, and the only things Hutts care about is their own self-interest. While the Republic trades with the Hutts out of necessity, common commercial activities inside Hutt Space such as spice-selling and slave trading are publicly condemned. But if you're willing to look the other way when it comes to moral and legal quandaries, and you can look after your self, Hutt Space isn't such a bad place.
