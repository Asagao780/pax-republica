summary: For countless generations, the Jedi Knights, an order of warrior-monks based out of Coruscant’s Jedi Temple, defend the ideals of peace and justice throughout the galaxy. The Jedi are a religious order who worship the Light Side of the Force, both serving it and using its power to fight against the forces of the Dark Side. The lightsaber is the signature weapon of the Jedi, who train since childhood to use it to protect themselves and innocent lives. Jedi are revered and respected in the Republic, but further from the Core Worlds they are sometimes seen as little more than myth and legend; some cultures even disdain the very idea of the Jedi.

For countless generations, the Jedi Knights, an order of warrior-monks based out of Coruscant’s Jedi Temple, allied with the Republic to defend peace, justice, and democracy throughout the galaxy. 

Twelve Jedi Masters make up the High Council, also known as the Jedi Council. The High Council represents the Jedi Order’s top leadership, including the Grand Master of the Order who is generally the oldest, wisest member. Second to the Grand Master is the Master of the Order, who leads the High Council in most day-to-day matters. These are nominated and voted on by the rest of the Council. 

As the defeat of the Sith was fairly recent, the Order is currently rather conservative in its views on wielding the Force. Essentially, the generally accepted view is that the Jedi way is the only way to the Light, and any other path will more than likely lead to the Dark Side. This means that any and all members of the Order are expected to adhere strictly to the Jedi tradition and rules established by the High Council. Furthermore, any Force wielder or Force sensitive outside of the Order is considered a potential threat at best and an enemy of the Jedi at worst.

###### The Code
The Jedi Code encompasses the central philosophies that the Jedi are expected to study, understand, and adhere to. It provides a guide when circumstances and events exceed expectations or experience.

_There is no emotion, there is peace._

_There is no ignorance, there is knowledge._

_There is no passion, there is serenity._

_There is no chaos, there is harmony._

_There is no death, there is the Force._

###### Ranks
Youngling - The Order seeks out young Force-sensitive children throughout the galaxy and brings them to its temples to begin their training.

Padawan - Through a rite of passage known as The Gathering, Younglings must enter the Crystal Caves of Ilum and retrieve a kyber crystal with which to assemble their own lightsaber. They may then advance to the rank of Padawan, typically under the tutelage of a more exerienced Knight or Master.

Knight - Once the High Council has determined that a Padawan has proven him or herself as a Jedi and mastered the Force, he/she will be granted the rank of Knight and released from apprenticeship. Most successful Jedi are able to reach this rank.

Master - Not all Jedi ever reach this level of mastery. However, if the Council has determined that a Knight has gained a high level of experience and wisdom, and has remained true to the Jedi way, they may grant the individual the rank of Jedi Master.
