summary: The Fringers are an unofficial coalition of beings hailing from worlds beyond the borders of the Galactic Republic. To survive in the far Outer Rim, one must be tough, clever and courageous. Even so, it's a hard life to go alone. Fringers look out for each other, because they know that no one else will; the Republic won't go out that far just to give them a helping hand. Whether you were born in the Outer Rim, or you came out here to find your fortune, if you've got guts and brains enough to survive, the Fringers may have a place for you.
