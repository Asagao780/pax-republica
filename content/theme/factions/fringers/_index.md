summary: The Outer Rim is a vast unexplored region of space, newly accessible by the discovery of new hyperspace routes by the Republic's intrepid explorers. New planets, and new opportunities are being uncovered every day, it seems, and brace, ambitious homesteaders make their way to the Rim in droves, hoping to strike it rich, or just start a new life. Life on the fringes of known space is hard, so far from the comfort of the Core Worlds and the Republic, but those who live there wouldn't have it any other way. Whether you were born in the Outer Rim, or newly arrived to make your fortune, if you don't need the safety of the Republic to help you sleep at night, the Fringers might be the place for you.
