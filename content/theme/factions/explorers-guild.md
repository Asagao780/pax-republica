The Explorers Guild is a group of Republic scouts dedicated to charting the uncharted and mapping the unmapped. This mission undoubtedly leads them to the most untouched regions of the Outer Rim, where they seek to discover new systems and map new hyperspace routes for the sake of the Galactic Republic. Members of the Explorers Guild often have a lust for adventure and a penchant for the unknown.
