The following factions are available for play on Pax Republica. To join a faction, you can either roleplay your way into one by being recruited in-character, or you can make membership in the faction part of your initial application. Players are not required to join a faction, and will be able to earn credits, participate in game-wide or individual plots regardless of membership, however faction-specific or inter-faction roleplay may be more difficult to become involved in if you're flying solo. Unaffiliated characters are assumed to be part of the Republic citizenry, however you may clarify your exact status with staff during the application process.
