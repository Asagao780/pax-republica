###### Bureaucracies
The Galactic Republic includes a massive bureaucracy of government-funded agencies, each with its own mission, director, and staff. Some agencies are large and vital to the Republic, like the Republic Tax Collection Agency. Others, such as the secretive Republic Special Weapons Group, are known only to select few. 

Not even the Chancellor is aware of every agency, and many continue to receive funding beyond their usefulness. Agency staff and directors are often apolitical, seeking careers in service to facts rather than aiming to score political points.

###### Bureau of Ships and Services (BoSS)
Responsible for maintaining a database of starship transponders and pilot's licenses going back millennia, BoSS works with customs and law enforcement to maintain and protect the hyperlanes. While formally a private agency, BoSS has a private contract with the Republic to provide its vital services.

###### Bureau of Sig, Spice, and Slavery
Initially formed centuries ago to combat organized crime, S3 is an intelligence collection and analysis agency. Criminals of the time favored notoriously inaccurate sig blaster gas for its armorÂ·piercing qualities, which almost led to a ban. S3 agents examine the weapons, spice, and slaves recovered from judicial arrests, tracing their histories to create a map of criminal networks. Senate corruption has been voting to erode the bureau's budget, staff, and facilities for decades.

###### Republic Correctional Authority
The RCA holds criminals in violation of Republic law and those deemed too dangerous for local holdine facilities. Normally staffed by judicial agents with specialized training, RCA facilities now also hold prisoners of war, and in such cases deploy specialized clone troopers as guards. The RCA operates prisons across the galaxy, including many deep-space prison stations and mobile prison ships. Many critics point to the luxurious accommodations at low-security facilities as being incredibly soft on corporate crime.

###### Republic Treasury
A vast agency with countless offices and bureaus, the Treasury is responsible for printing Republic credits, also known as dataries. Treasury agents investigate currency manipulation. fraud, and counterfeiting. Since leaving the aurodium standard long ago, the Republic has collaborated with major banks like the Bank of the Core, as well as with the Banking Clan, to hold a credit reserve to ensure currency stability. Some economists, experts, and politicians fear that the banks have too much power, and that the Republic relies overly on them.

###### Space Rescue Corps
The red and black of the Space Rescue Corps is a welcome sign to spacers in distress, and the corps counts some of the best pilots field medics, and mechanics among its ranks. The SRC searches for missing ships, responds to distress calls, and hunts for survivors after space battles. The models it most commonly uses are the nimble Sprint-class rescue craft and, for larger jobs, the disc-hulled Corellian rescue frigate.
