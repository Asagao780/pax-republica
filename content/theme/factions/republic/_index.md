summary: The Galactic Republic governs most of civilized space, from the Core Worlds to the Colonies, and is establishing a foothold in the Outer Rim. The Republic has stood for thousands of years, and promises to stand for thousands more, offering safety, peace, and prosperity to its citizens. The Jedi Order works alongside Republic forces to maintain this peace throughout Galaxy, while the Senate creates laws to govern the vast coalition of planets and peoples. Are you a Republic Sector Ranger, maintaining law and order in your little corner of space? A Senate aide learning the ropes of politics and government? Or a diplomat seeking to establish relationships with the newly discovered species of the Outer Rim? The Republic welcomes you.

The Republic is the ancient democracy that governs most of civilized space. The chief legislative body of the Republic, the Galactic Senate, governs Republic space from its central seat on the Core world of Coruscant. The Senate is also the Republic's primary tool of diplomacy, and Senators frequently join Jedi to mediate disputes between regional powers.
