###### Judicial Department
The Judicial Department, the Republic's primary law enforcement entity, operates out of the Judicial Arcology building, which dominates Coruscant's Judicial Plaza. The Judicial Department, which is subordinate to the Chancellor's office, oversees countless offices tasked with investigating, trying, and sentencing offenders. The collaborative nature of these offices has fed cries of corruption and conflicts of interest throughout Republic history.

###### The Courts
Most legal issues are resolved locally, covered either by regional or planetary legal systems. Galactic laws primarily concern issues between planets, such as taxation and trade between systems or crimes committed outside orbital space. The bulk of Republic court cases involve large corporations, regional governments, or pirates and outlaws operating across multiple sectors.

Sentients' rights cases also work their way through the Republic court, sometimes appealing all the way to the Republic's Supreme Court. The courts have a small army of prosecutors, barristers, bureaucrats, researchers, and subject matter experts within their ranks for trying cases.

###### Republic Office of Criminal Investigations
The ROCI manages subordinate law enforcement agencies and the Republic Enforcement DataCore, which tracks Republic bounties ROCI sector coordinators oversee regional judicial forces and liaise with local law enforcement to smooth over any jurisdictional issues. The ROCI also coordinates with the Jedi Order when Jedi accompany official Republic investigations.

###### Republic Security Force
Known as “judicials,” Republic Security Force agents, recognizable for their blue or red tunics, are the Republic's primary law enforcement agents. Judicials investigate corporate and government entities, as well as combat pirates and organized crime. They maintain a sizable fleet of ships to support local patrols, far-flung investigations, and counterpiracy operations.

The judicials frequently work alongside the Jedi. While some members resent the Jedi Order's privileged status, most respect Jedi insight. However, judicials are concerned with acquiring evidence for courtroom justice, whereas the Jedi sometimes mete out their own, streamlined brand of justice, creating friction between the two groups. Still, regardless of personal feelings, most judicials treat the Jedi with professional courtesy.

###### Sector Rangers
Assigned to a sector of space, Sector Rangers pursue criminals deemed too dangerous for local officers. Members of one of the oldest law enforcement institutions in the Republic, the Sector Rangers are highly capable trackers and warriors. They operate alone or in small crews to hunt the worst of the worst, and they have the legal authority to deputize willing locals in the pursuit of dangerous criminals. Special Enforcement Officers (SEOs) are the Sector Rangers' elite and have the jurisdictional freedom to cross sector boundaries in pursuit of their targets. SEOs frequently work alongside Jedi to bring the most dangerous criminals to trial, whether that occurs inside a local courthouse or Republic courtroom.
