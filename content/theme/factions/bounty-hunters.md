The Bounty Hunters Guild or simply “the Guild” is a group of mercenaries and bounty hunters that operates primarily in the Outer Rim. Guild leaders gather pucks from clients and determine assignments, although most members handle the jobs themselves alone. While individual bounty hunters receive the bulk of the payment for each job, the Guild does take a cut, which must be agreed upon before any hunter joins. Additionally, one must prove his prowess as a bounty hunter to be worthy of membership in the Guild.
