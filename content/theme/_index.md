Pax Republica is set in the Star Wars Universe roughly 300 years before the events of Star Wars Episode IV. The Republic and the Jedi are both at the height of their power, as new systems and regions are discovered in the Outer Rim of the Galaxy. The Jedi work diligently to maintain peace, in an ongoing effort to prevent the re-emergence of the Sith, or any who would use the Dark Side to terrorize and enslave the Galaxy.
